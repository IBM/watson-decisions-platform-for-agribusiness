## IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite integration for Maximo Spatial Assets </h1> 

IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite integrates with the IBM Maximo solutions suite to simplify GeoSpatial monitoring of client Maximo assets for additional insight. Release 1.0 empowers users to import Maximo Asset Locations in order to expand their exploration of weather and other geospatial data layers. In order to perform the import operation, you would require the URL of the Maximo instance, Maximo API credentials and Environmental Intelligence Suite user credentials issued to you at the time of provisioning. 

<b>Action</b>: Ask your IBM representative to provide a IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite `API_KEY` for your user. 

## Generate JWT token to access IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite Service APIs
  
<b>Substitute `<API_KEY>` in the following request and call it in a terminal window </b>: 

 ```
 curl --request POST --url https://auth-b2b-twc.wsitrader.com/Auth/GetBearerForClient --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'cache-control: no-cache' --data '{"apiKey":"<API_KEY>", "clientId":"ibm-agro-api"}'
 ```

<b>Response</b>: 

  ``` json
  {"access_token":"<JWT_TOKEN>","expires_in":"xxxxxx","token_type":"Bearer","scope":"xxxxxxx"}
  ```
 
<b>Action</b>:

  Copy the value corresponding to `<JWT_TOKEN>` from the repsonse above to use in the Import API call below. This token would expire within the expiration window indicated by 'expires_in', following which you can repeat the JWT generation call above to get a refreshed token.
